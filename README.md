A tool to control the fan speed by monitoring the temperature of CPU via IPMI.

## Why

Our Dell R730 server's iDRAC is not works as expected. The fan always run full speed. And is very noisy, We digged but didn't fix out. So I build this to control the fan speed programmatically. And use RUST just for practice. Any contribute are welcome.

## Usage
